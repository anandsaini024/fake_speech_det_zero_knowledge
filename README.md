# Zero-Knowledge Faked Speech Detection

This project implements a neural network-based digital forensics tool for detecting artificially generated speech without requiring any reference or source audio â€” a concept known as **zero-knowledge detection**. The system is designed to support real-time applications such as speech-to-text, voice authentication, and secure voice-based interactions.

## Overview

Traditional fake speech detection systems often rely on comparing suspect audio with reference or original speech. In contrast, this project introduces a zero-knowledge detection method that identifies synthetic or manipulated audio using only intrinsic acoustic features.

Key features include:
- No dependence on reference audio
- Robust feature extraction (spectral and cepstral)
- Real-time inference
- Standalone operation suitable for deployment

## Key Technologies

- Python, NumPy
- PyTorch (neural network training and inference)
- Librosa / torchaudio (audio processing)
- Spectral and cepstral analysis (e.g., MFCCs)
- CNNs / RNNs (classification model)

## Applications
- Speech-to-text (S2T) verification
- Voice biometric systems
- Audio-based content moderation
- Real-time conference monitoring
